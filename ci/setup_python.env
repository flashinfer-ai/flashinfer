# CI Python Environment Overrides
# ================================
# This file allows overriding Python package versions for CI testing.
# Useful for testing specific commits of dependencies before they are released.
#
# Usage:
#   1. In a test PR, uncomment and set the variable(s) below
#   2. CI will install the specified version(s) before running tests
#   3. Do NOT merge these changes to main - close the PR after testing
#
# Example:
#   TVM_FFI_REF=abc123def456  # Test a specific TVM-FFI commit
#   TVM_FFI_REF=main          # Test TVM-FFI main branch
#   TVM_FFI_REF=v0.2.0        # Test a specific tag

# Uncomment to override TVM-FFI version:
# TVM_FFI_REF=
