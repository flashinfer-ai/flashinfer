# "native" is a special value for CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES which means use the architectures of the host's GPU.
# it's new in CMake 3.24, if you are using an older of CMake or you want to use a different value, you can
# set its value here. Supported CUDA architctures include 80;86;89;90
# Example:
# set(FLASHINFER_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES 80)
