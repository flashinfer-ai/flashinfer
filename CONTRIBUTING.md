# Installation

For development, the easiest way to install flashinfer is through editable installation:

```
git clone git@github.com:flashinfer-ai/flashinfer.git --recursive
pip install --no-build-isolation -e . -v
```

We recommend using the `--no-build-isolation` flag to ensure compatibility with your existing environment. Without it, `pip` may attempt to resolve dependencies (e.g., `torch`) from PyPI, which could pull in packages built with older CUDA versions and lead to incompatibility issues.

# Code Structure

```
flashinfer/
| --include/  # kernel definitions and common utilities functions
| --csrc/  # op registration to frameworks (pytorch), and binding codes
| --python/  # python interface exposed to users
| --docs/  # documentation (using sphinx)
| --tests/  # unittests in python (using pytest)
| --benchmarks/  # kernel benchmarks in python
| --3rdparty/  # 3rdparty dependencies such as cutlass
```

Kernel definitions (framework-agnostic cuda code, accepting raw pointer as input) should be placed under the `include` directory. Whenever possible, reuse existing FlashInfer infrastructure such as logging, exception handling, and utility functions.
The operator registration code (i.e., framework-specific components, accepting torch tensors as input) should reside in the `csrc` directory. This is where Torch headers may be included and operators can be bound to PyTorch. Note that Torch headers must not be included in any files under the `include` directory.

Code Contribution Procedure
* Write kernel definitions in `include/`
* Write kernel registration and pytorch interface under `csrc/`
* Write python interface under `python/`
* Write unit tests in `tests/`
* (Optional) Add benchmark suites under `benchmark/`
* Update (python) documentation index under `docs/`
* Update `pyproject.toml` if you created new module in flashinfer

# Release Versioning

When incrementing a version and creating a release, follow a "right-shifted" versioning scheme similar to [vLLM Release Versioning](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/RELEASE.md)[^1]. In particular, versions follow _major.minor.patch[.post1]_, where:

* _major_ increment signals architectural milestone and/or when incompatible API changes are made, similar to PyTorch 2.0.
* _minor_ increment signals significant backwards-compatible new features
* _patch_ increment signals small backwards-compatible features (e.g. new kernels, new SM support, etc) and backwards-compatible bug fixes
* _post1_ is an optional suffix for a quick follow up release with just backwards-compatible bug fixes

[^1]: We have not followed this strictly through v0.4.0. But after v0.4.0, the versioning should follow this "right shifted" versioning scheme.
