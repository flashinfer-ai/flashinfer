        Compute the matrix multiplication between a batch of input tensor (with variable number of rows, but fixed
        number of columns) and a batch of weight tensor with fixed number of rows and columns:

        .. math::

            y[i] = x[i] \times W[i]

        if :attr:`weight_indices` is provided, we will select the weight tensor based on the indices in the
        :attr:`weight_indices` tensor:

        .. math::

            y[i] = x[i] \times W[\text{weight_indices}[i]]

        We use Ragged Tensor to represent the input tensor :attr:`x` and the output tensor :attr:`y`, and each x[i]
        is a segment of the concatenated tensor. Please see :ref:`Ragged Tensor tutorial <ragged-layout>` for more details.
        We use a ``seg_len`` or ``seg_indptr`` tensor (either would work) to indicate the start and end of each segment,
        where the ``seg_indptr`` is the cumulative sum of the ``seg_lens`` tensor (with an additional 0 at the beginning):

        .. math::

            \text{seg_indptr}[i] = \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \text{seg_lens}[j], \quad \text{seg_indptr}[0] = 0

        - If ``seg_lens`` is provided, then :attr:`x` has shape ``(sum(seg_lens), d_in)`` and :attr:`y` has shape
            ``(sum(seg_lens), d_out)``, where ``d_in`` is the number of columns of the input tensor and ``d_out`` is the
            number of columns of the output tensor.
        - If ``seg_indptr`` is provided, then :attr:`x` has shape ``(seg_indptr[-1], d_in)`` and :attr:`y` has shape
            ``(seg_indptr[-1], d_out)``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : torch.Tensor
            The input tensor with shape ``(sum(seg_lens), d_in)``.
        weights : torch.Tensor
            The 3D weight tensor with shape ``(num_weights, d_in, d_out)`` if :attr:`weight_column_major` is ``False``,
            or ``(num_weights, d_out, d_in)`` if :attr:`weight_column_major` is ``True``.
        batch_size : int
            The number of segments.
        weight_column_major : bool
            Whether the weight tensor is column major.
        seg_lens : Optional[torch.Tensor]
            The length of each segment, with shape ``(batch_size,)``, expects a 1D tensor of dtype ``torch.int64``.
        seg_indptr : Optional[torch.Tensor]
            The indptr of the segments, with shape ``(batch_size + 1,)``, expects a 1D tensor of dtype ``torch.int64``.
            If this is provided, then :attr:`seg_lens` will be ignored, otherwise ``seg_indptr`` will be computed
            internally from :attr:`seg_lens`.
        weight_indices : Optional[torch.Tensor]
            The indices of the weight tensor to be selected for each segment, with shape ``(batch_size,)``.
            Expects a 1D tensor of dtype ``torch.int64``.
            If this is provided, then the weight tensor will be selected based on the indices in this tensor.

        Returns
        -------
        torch.Tensor
            The output tensor with shape ``(sum(seg_lens), d_out)``.
