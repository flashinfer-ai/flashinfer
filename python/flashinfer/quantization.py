    The semantics of this function is the same as `numpy.packbits <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.packbits.html>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: torch.Tensor
        The 1D binary-valued array to pack.
    bitorder: str
        The bit-order ("bit"/"little") of the output. Default is "big".

    Returns
    -------
    y: torch.Tensor
        An uint8 packed array, shape ``((x.size(0) + 7) / 8),)``.

    For each segment, the semantics of this function is the same as `numpy.packbits <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.packbits.html>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: torch.Tensor
        The 1D binary-valued array to pack, shape ``(indptr[-1],)``.
    indptr: torch.Tensor
        The index pointer of each segment in :attr:`x`, shape ``(batch_size + 1,)``.
        The i-th segment in :attr:`x` is ``x[indptr[i]:indptr[i+1]]``.
    bitorder: str
        The bit-order ("bit"/"little") of the output. Default is "big".

    Returns
    -------
    y: torch.Tensor
        An uint8 packed array, shape: ``(new_indptr[-1],)``.
        The ``y[new_indptr[i]:new_indptr[i+1]]`` contains the packed bits ``x[indptr[i]:indptr[i+1]]``.
    new_indptr: torch.Tensor
        The new index pointer of each packed segment in :attr:`y`, shape ``(batch_size + 1,)``.
        It's guaranteed that ``new_indptr[i+1] - new_indptr[i] == (indptr[i+1] - indptr[i] + 7) // 8``.
