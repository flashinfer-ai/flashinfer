    where the draft model generates a sequence(chain) of tokens for each request.

    Parameters
    ----------
    draft_probs: torch.Tensor
        The probability over vocabulary generated by draft model.
        Shape: ``(batch_size, num_speculate_tokens, vocab_size)``
    draft_token_ids: torch.Tensor
        The draft model's generated token indices.

    uniform_samples: torch.Tensor
        The uniform samples used as needle for sampling, shape ``(batch_size, num_speculate_tokens + 1)``.
        Expected to be uniformly distributed in ``[0, 1)``.
    target_probs: torch.Tensor
        The probability over vocabulary generated by target model.
        Compared to input :attr:`draft_probs`, the target model's probability has an additional
        slot at the end because the target model will generate one more token than the draft model.
        Shape: ``(batch_size, num_speculate_tokens + 1, vocab_size)``
    deterministic: bool
        Whether to use deterministic kernel implementation, default is ``True``.

    -------
    output_token_ids: torch.Tensor
        The output token indices verified by the target model, rejected samples are
        padded with ``-1``.
        Compared to input :attr:`draft_token_ids`, the output tensor has an additional
        token index at the end for the final token, if all previous tokens are accepted,
        another "bonus" token will be sampled from the target model's probability.
