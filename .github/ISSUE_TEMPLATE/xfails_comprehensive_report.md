## 🚨 Critical Issue: Test Infrastructure Technical Debt

**Auto-generated issue to track and fix test skips and expected failures in FlashInfer.**

### 📊 Executive Summary

The FlashInfer test suite currently has **143 test skips and expected failures** that represent significant technical debt and limit the project's reliability and hardware compatibility.

| Category | Count | Impact Level |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| 🖥️ **Hardware Requirements** | **51** | **CRITICAL** |
| 🚫 **Feature Unsupported** | **31** | **HIGH** |
| ⚠️ **Parameter Validation** | **21** | **MEDIUM** |
| 🔧 **Backend Limitations** | **4** | **MEDIUM** |
| 🌐 **Environment Issues** | **2** | **LOW** |
| 📂 **Other** | **34** | **VARIES** |

### 🔥 Most Critical Issues

#### 1. Hardware Compatibility Crisis (51 issues - CRITICAL)
- **SM90A support failures**: 10 test failures across core functionality
- **Modern GPU incompatibility**: SM110/120/121 GPUs not supported by TensorRT-LLM integration
- **Compute capability gaps**: Features require specific GPU generations with no fallbacks

**Business Impact**: Users with newer/older GPU hardware cannot fully utilize FlashInfer.

#### 2. Missing Feature Support (31 issues - HIGH)
- **FlashAttention 3**: 9 test failures due to incomplete FA3 integration
- **Sequence length limitations**: Multiple causal attention restrictions for `qo_len > kv_len`
- **Backend feature gaps**: Inconsistent feature support across CUDNN/Cutlass/TensorRT-LLM

**Business Impact**: Limited functionality compared to competing libraries.

#### 3. Parameter Validation Failures (21 issues - MEDIUM)
- **Head configuration**: Requirements like `num_qo_heads` divisible by `num_kv_heads`
- **Vocabulary/sampling**: Invalid parameter combinations cause silent failures
- **Block sparse configuration**: Insufficient validation of size relationships

**Business Impact**: Poor developer experience with unclear error messages.

### 📋 Detailed Action Plan

#### Phase 1: Hardware Compatibility (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] **Audit SM90A support** - Determine why SM90A is marked unsupported
- [ ] **TensorRT-LLM compatibility** - Work with NVIDIA on SM110/120/121 support
- [ ] **Hardware abstraction layer** - Implement fallback mechanisms
- [ ] **Compatibility matrix** - Document supported hardware combinations

#### Phase 2: Feature Implementation (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] **Complete FA3 integration** - Fix 9 FlashAttention 3 related failures
- [ ] **Causal attention with long sequences** - Support `qo_len > kv_len` cases
- [ ] **Backend feature parity** - Ensure consistent features across backends
- [ ] **Missing functionality** - Implement high-priority unsupported features

#### Phase 3: Parameter Validation (Weeks 9-10)
- [ ] **Centralized validation** - Create unified parameter checking system
- [ ] **Better error messages** - Provide actionable feedback for invalid configs
- [ ] **Configuration helpers** - Add utilities to validate parameter combinations
- [ ] **Documentation** - Clear parameter requirement documentation

#### Phase 4: Infrastructure Improvement (Weeks 11-12)
- [ ] **Test categorization** - Separate hardware-dependent from logic tests
- [ ] **Conditional execution** - Better hardware detection and graceful degradation
- [ ] **CI/CD integration** - Automated tracking of xfail reduction
- [ ] **Monitoring dashboard** - Track progress over time

### 🎯 Success Metrics

**Primary Goals (6 months):**
- Reduce total xfails from 143 to < 50 (-65%)
- Achieve 95% test pass rate on supported hardware
- Zero hardware compatibility failures for supported GPUs
- Complete FA3 integration (0 FA3-related failures)

**Secondary Goals:**
- All parameter validation issues resolved
- Consistent feature support across backends
- Automated xfail tracking in CI/CD
- Comprehensive hardware compatibility documentation
