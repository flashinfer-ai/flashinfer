    Identical instruction to :func:`blk_copy`; the only difference is that the
    destination is passed as an already-computed byte address instead of being
    read off a tensor iterator. That lets the caller name memory belonging to a
    peer GPU, whose base pointer is only known at runtime (see
    ``SymmetricBuffer.peer_addresses`` in
    ``flashinfer/comm/mnnvl_cutedsl/symmetric_buffer.py``), rather than a
    compile-time-known ``out`` tensor.

    Peer memory is ordinary mapped global memory here, so no reduction variant
    is needed: the MoE peer-scatter path gives every ``(token, k_slot)`` route
    its own destination slot and therefore has exactly one writer per row.
