# Vendoring record: cutedsl_megamoe

One `kernel_src/` directory = one upstream kernel repo snapshot. This file
records *provenance and sync state* only; the drop-update *workflow* (what to
replace, what to audit) lives in `SKILL.md`.

## Upstream

- **Repo**: NVIDIA CuTeDSL MegaMoE kernel team's repo (see `ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.md`
  for authors/contacts). <!-- TODO: pin the repo URL -->
- **Vendored commit**: <!-- TODO: record the upstream SHA of the current src/ drop -->
- **Last synced**: <!-- TODO: date of the current drop -->
- **Vendored subset**: the four kernel packages only (`common/`, `src/`,
  `moe_mxfp8_glu/`, `moe_nvfp4_swapab/`) under `src/` — no repo scaffolding
  (`ci/`, `tester/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `pyproject.toml`, …).

## Policy

- `src/` is a **verbatim** copy of the upstream drop: no injected files, no
  local edits. `diff -r src/<pkg> <upstream>/<pkg>` must come back clean.
- All adaptation lives in `shim/` (ours), re-exported through `__init__.py`;
  FlashInfer backends import the package `__init__` only, never `src/`.
- Local bug fixes go upstream first, then re-sync. If an emergency local edit
  is unavoidable, list it here as a pending-upstream diff until the next drop
  absorbs it.

## Pending local diffs vs upstream

- `src/src/inputs_process.py` is synced **ahead** of the recorded drop, to
  upstream commit `50117315dbcd2ffb1e8c1c4dab4be9b42cad24ab`
  (<https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/bangyus/cutedsl_megamoe/-/blob/50117315dbcd2ffb1e8c1c4dab4be9b42cad24ab/src/inputs_process.py>),
  taken 2026-08-10: the kernel team's fix for the fused activation-quant
  staging breaking on CuTe-DSL 4.7 (mxfp8 path reworked so each lane owns one
  contiguous 16-byte fp8 store, lane pairs reduce the 32-element block amax
  via shuffle; plus a hidden-size row-alignment guard in `__init__`).
  ONLY this one file is ahead: at that commit upstream also renamed
  `common/host_utils.py`'s `mxfp8_quantize_per_block_32` to `..._row`, and
  pulling that file forward breaks the rest of the recorded drop (shim
  `kernel_helpers`, `mega_reference*.py` — the rename ripples through
  `mega_reference.py`'s changed return signature into the runners). Known
  cost: the harness at the bottom of `inputs_process.py`
  (`python -m src.inputs_process`) fails its **mxfp8** case with an
  ImportError against the recorded-drop `host_utils` — the nvfp4 cases and
  every shim/kernel path are unaffected (the kernel code imports
  `host_utils` nowhere). The harness was validated green (3/3 cases, dsl
  4.6.1 + 4.7.0) with the newer `host_utils` before this was understood.
  Resolves at the next full re-sync once the tree moves past that commit.
- `src/moe_nvfp4_swapab/runner_common.py` carries a local
  `_check_triton_flat_index` guard (added for PR #4113 review) on the
  int32-indexed Triton helpers (`_rcp_approx_kernel`, `_swiglu_pair_kernel`);
  `_pack_fp4_kernel` is exempt because it widens its flat index to int64 for
  the > 2**31-element combine round-trip. Send upstream on the next re-sync.

## Related trees

- `kernel_src/sm90/pull_style_cutedsl_megakernel/` is a **separate snapshot**
  of a fork of this repo (older common code, Hopper FP8 pull kernel). It is
  not merged into this directory on purpose: one kernel_src dir = one upstream
  commit. If upstream merges the SM90 kernel into the mother repo, fold that
  tree into this one on the next re-sync.
