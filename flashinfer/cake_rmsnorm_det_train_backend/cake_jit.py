Host plan and loader glue of the Cake BF16 RMSNorm training kernels
(SM100 / SM103 / SM107).

Every module below is one mechanically exported production build: a CUDA
device translation unit plus a tvm-ffi binding compiled together for exactly
one architecture.  ``MODULES``, ``ROUTES`` and ``HIDDEN_SIZES`` are filled by
the exporter from the complete verified program bundle and carry the host plan
only: the kernel's ``library`` stem, the architectures it is delivered for, its
launch / selection / chunking rules and the kernel-parameter -> logical-argument
map.  What to compile -- sources, digests, nvcc flags -- is recorded once in
``build.json`` next to this file; :mod:`.cake_build` serves the library
``<library>_<arch>`` from a prebuilt ``aot/`` file when a builder compiled it
and otherwise through FlashInfer's JIT from the same sources and flags,
verifying every source digest before the first build.

A route is the ordered list of module records one public call launches:
``fwd`` / ``fwd_residual`` launch one kernel; ``bwd`` / ``bwd_residual``
launch a pair -- the main kernel, whose persistent CTAs claim row chunks from
a counter in the workspace and write one FP32 partial row of ``dw`` per chunk,
then the dw reduce kernel under programmatic dependent launch, which folds the
partial rows into ``dw`` in chunk order.  No launch is cooperative, so a
backward never waits for the whole device.  Token counts are runtime
scalars, so a changed number of rows never recompiles anything.

A module record is one (kernel, launch policy) pair.  A kernel launched under
several policies -- a different persistent grid or row range per stage -- has
one record per policy (``<kernel>__<stage>`` after the first), all naming the
kernel's ``library``, so it is compiled once.
