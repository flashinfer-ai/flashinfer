"""Self-sampling GVR top-K decode — host side (dispatch, workspace, entry).

Provenance: ported near-verbatim from TensorRT-LLM
``tensorrt_llm/_torch/cute_dsl_kernels/blackwell/top_k/gvr_topk_decode_self_sampling_host.py``
(PR NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM#17821, commit ed94d4cfbf). FlashInfer-local changes:
module rename and this note; ``_varlen_launcher`` keeps the kernels' row-read
bound at the physical width and inflates only the routing value (DKG #60);
``warmup_varlen`` populates the exact-row launchers on every call (DKG #60);
``validate_run_ws`` enforces the 16-byte alignment the compiled workspace
declares; ``run_varlen`` rejects overlapping row layouts; ``run``/``run_ws``/
``run_varlen`` re-enter under the logits device and every compile passes an
explicit ``--gpu-arch``; ``route()`` adds two register-kernel rungs in the
4K < n <= 8K band (VPT=2 for b <= sms, BLK=512 for sms < b <= 2*sms) and sizes its
register band by the device SM count ``sms`` instead of the hard-coded 148
(see the inline note; DKG #61); ``run_varlen`` accepts ``pre_idx=None`` and runs
the hint-free compiled engines (TRT-LLM #18410: identity sample, no hint loads;
``_varlen_launcher(..., hint_free=True)``).
FlashInfer's ``top_k_varlen(backend="gvr_2")``
calls ``run_varlen`` below; the batch-uniform ``run``/``run_ws`` entries are
kept for parity tests and benchmarking. Keep future diffs against upstream
mechanical.

Companion to ``gvr2_topk_decode.py`` (the device module).
Three sections:

1. dispatch — the CUDA host dispatch as a pure function
   ``route(b, n, npad, k)``;
2. workspace — one zero-initialised slab (20,973,568 B) per (device, CUDA
   stream) via the torch caching allocator (FlashInfer-local: upstream keys
   it per device), with keep-alive + double-checked locking, eager-only;
3. operator entry — ``run(logits, pre_idx, n_valid, indices)`` /
   ``run_ws(..., workspace)`` DPS forms with input hardening and a
   bind-once launch cache keyed on ``(b, n, npad, k)``.

OPERATOR CONTRACT (batch-uniform entries): ``n_valid`` is one host python
int for the whole batch — every row shares the same valid prefix, in
COMPRESSED index space (the caller applies any ``compressRatio`` division).
``pre_idx`` is consumed as-is — raw prev-step top-K indices, uniformly for
DSv3.2 / DSv4 Flash / Pro. The +1 temporal shift ``heuristicTopKDecode.cu``
applies for cr==1 is deliberately dropped: hints only steer the sampling
ladder (exactness never depends on them), and raw prev-step hints overlap
the current top-K at least as well as +1-shifted ones on real decode data,
so one offset-free hint convention serves all three models. The production
per-row contract (per-request ``kv_lens`` read on-device, per-row MTP
offsets — sync-free and CUDA-graph-replay safe with growing KV) is
implemented by ``run_varlen``, which is the entry the opt-in DSA dispatch
seam calls. The batch-uniform ``run``/``run_ws`` entries keep the simpler
contract (one host-side ``n_valid`` for the whole batch), are exercised for
unit tests and benchmarking only, and must not be substituted for
``run_varlen`` under continuous batching, MTP (``next_n > 1``), or
CUDA-graph capture.

# ===========================================================================

# ===========================================================================
"""Pure-Python mirror of the GVR CUDA host dispatch (gvr_topk_launch).

route(b, n, npad, k) is a PURE function of its four ints -- no env knobs, no
GPU, stdlib only.  It returns the kernel family, its compile-time template
tuple, the runtime scalar pack `rt`, grid/cluster/block geometry, smem size,
and whether the family needs the workspace.

rt carries the FULL runtime scalar list each kernel receives, in signature
order, always starting with (n, npad, k).

Dead ABI-parity args: gvr_main's `int SCAP_, int CMP_` params are NEVER read
by the kernel body -- it recomputes them as constexprs that mirror the host
formulas bit-identically.  They are kept in rt purely for ABI parity.
gvr_clus's SCAP/CMP are LIVE runtime args.  `aim` and `SFAC` are host-side
intermediates only (never cross the ABI), so they do not appear in rt.

C-semantics notes encoded here:
  * every `/` on ints is C truncating division -> Python `//` (all operands
    are non-negative on every reachable path);
  * `sel = (long long)SFAC * n / aim` and the TGT/TGT2 products are 64-bit in C;
    Python ints are exact, so `//` reproduces them;
  * `int r = (int)(0.5 + sqrt((double)(6LL*n)))` truncates toward zero after
    the +0.5 -> `int(0.5 + math.sqrt(float(6*n)))`;
  * `IMGW = (n + 3) & ~3` four-element float4 round-up;
  * the reg-block CMP (possibly widened to n by DEGE) is scoped to the
    register-resident block; the streaming path re-derives its own CMP.

"""Default workspace slabs for the multi-CTA SPLIT path.

Semantics:
  * ONE zero-initialised slab per (device index, raw CUDA stream handle),
    lazily allocated through the torch caching allocator by the first EAGER
    slab-using launch on that stream (never under CUDA-graph capture);
  * keep-alive store: module dict `_ws_keep` (tensor refcount = keep-alive);
  * double-checked locking: lock-free hot-path load (a GIL-atomic dict get
    plays an acquire load), slow path re-checks under a mutex;
  * device index bounds `0 <= d < GVR_MAX_DEV` -- checked BEFORE the
    CUDA-ness of the tensor (run() resolves the default workspace before the
    input checks, so a CPU logits tensor dies here with "device index out of
    range: -1").

Concurrent streams on one device each get their own slab, so launches that
overlap in time (distinct streams, graphs captured on different streams and
replayed together) never share mutable scratch; a caller-provided workspace
(run_ws() / `workspace=`) is optional, not required for concurrency. Two
graphs captured on the SAME stream share that stream's slab and are correct
as long as they replay in stream order. The number of slabs equals the number
of distinct stream handles that have run an eager slab-using launch:
`torch.cuda.Stream()` recycles handles from a fixed pool (32 per device and
priority), but externally created / foreign stream handles are not bounded by
that pool; `release_cached_resources()` frees them all.

    """Production-contract varlen entry (per-row device kv_lens).

    HINT-FREE: ``pre_idx=None`` runs the hint-free compiled engines (identity
    sample in place of the hint, no hint loads; TRT-LLM #18410) and then
    REQUIRES ``top_k`` (normally ``k = pre_idx.shape[1]``). Exact like the
    hinted call; only the sampling anchor is weaker. When both are given they
    must agree. Hint mode is a warm-up dimension: hinted and hint-free
    launchers are distinct compiled objects (``warmup_varlen`` compiles both).

    WINDOWED / PREFILL (TRT-LLM #18702 port): ``row_starts`` int32 ``[num_rows]``
    makes row ``r``'s candidates ``logits[r, ks : ks + kv_lens[r])`` with
    ``ks = row_starts[r]`` (compressed column units) and the output indices
    LOCAL to the window (``column - ks``; the absolute column with
    ``absolute_indices=True``), ``-1`` padded, identity for short
    windows — the DSA prefill indexer contract (packed requests along the
    column axis, causal per-row windows). Hint-free only, ``next_n == 1`` and
    ``compress_ratio == 1``; columns outside a window are never read. Runs the
    dedicated prefill engines of the streaming ``main`` family (one CTA per
    row); ``warmup_prefill`` compiles them ahead of CUDA-graph capture.

    Row semantics (mirror of ``heuristicTopKDecode.cu`` and the in-tree
    ``cute_dsl_gvr_topk_decode`` runner):

      ``num_rows = logits.shape[0]``, ``batch = num_rows // next_n``;
      ``kv_lens`` int32 ``[batch]`` — per-request TOTAL cache length in
      UNCOMPRESSED token space (dsa.py ``metadata.kv_lens_cuda_runtime``,
      not new-token seq_lens); row ``r`` uses
      ``n_r = (kv_lens[r // next_n] - next_n + (r % next_n) + 1) //
      compress_ratio`` valid entries (cr 1 = DSv3.2, 4 = DSv4 Flash/Pro);
      ``pre_idx`` ``[batch, k]`` is REQUEST-level raw prev-step top-K,
      shared by a request's ``next_n`` rows (offset-free hint contract);
      per-row ``n_r <= k`` takes the short path (identity + ``-1`` tail).

    ENGINES: ``engine="auto"`` (default) launches the per-row IN-KERNEL
    gvr_main varlen port — ONE launch for the whole batch; each CTA reads its
    row's kv_len on device and re-derives the sampling ladder (route_dynamic
    formula mirror), so with ``max_seq_len`` given (a capture-stable engine
    constant, e.g. dsa.py's ``indexer_max_seq_len``) the call performs NO
    host reads.  Without ``max_seq_len`` the envelope comes from ONE
    ``kv_lens.max()`` host read (documented sync, refused under capture).
    With ``row_starts`` (windowed mode) ``max_seq_len`` is the max WINDOW
    length and only selects the plan tier / envelope bucket; the kernel
    always clamps windows to the logits width, never to ``max_seq_len``.
    ``engine="reference"`` keeps the b=1 host-loop reference implementation —
    the differential oracle the in-kernel engine is validated against.

    KNOWN LIMITATION: on rows containing NaN logits the selected index SET
    can differ from ``heuristicTopKDecode.cu`` (both kernels order NaNs
    implementation-specifically). Finite inputs — including +/-inf and
    denormals — are tie-aware exact.

    CONTRACT: correct and dispatched for any ``num_rows``
    (BS 1..1024+ x next_n) and any envelope up to 1M kv tokens.  Family
    selection (streaming main / clustered register-resident) is a pure
    function of the capture-stable launcher key.

    One tiny real launch per requested ``num_rows`` and hint mode (hinted and

    is recorded only after every launch succeeds, so a failed or interrupted
    warmup is retried on the next call instead of short-circuiting to an
    uncompiled engine.

    ``row_stride`` must be the logits row stride the serving producer will
    emit: the launcher key includes it, so a warmup at a different stride
    compiles a variant dispatch never looks up. Callers that know the
    producer layout (e.g. the DSL paged-MQA arena's 256-element rounding)
    must pass it; the 64-element default only matches producers that round
    the same way.

    ``page_size`` additionally compiles the PAGED hint-free engines and
