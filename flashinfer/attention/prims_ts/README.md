# Experimental Task-Scheduled Attention

`flashinfer.attention.prims_ts` exposes experimental CuTe DSL attention
kernels for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. Scheduling, tile selection, and split-KV
reduction are implementation details; the public interfaces expose attention
and cache semantics without tuning knobs.

Current accuracy and performance signoff is on SM100a/B200. SM103a/B300 is
admitted by the runtime architecture guard but is not yet signoff-qualified.

The component guides define supported shapes, layouts, metadata lifetime,
output/workspace ownership, examples, limitations, and validation commands.

For `BlockSparsePagedTSWrapper`, `plan` freezes only the compact fixed-Q
geometry, dtypes, sparse-route capacity, and `max_seq_len_kv`; it retains no
request metadata. Every `run` reads live paged-KV row offsets, physical page
IDs, per-request K/V lengths, per-KV-head sparse routes, and optional token
bits from device tensors. The physical-page ID tensor is capacity: its live
prefix ends at `paged_kv_indptr[-1]`, which may be smaller than its `numel()`.
The caller owns every live value contract: dense K/V lengths must be in
`[1, max_seq_len_kv]`, and causal lengths must be in `[Sq, max_seq_len_kv]`.
`paged_kv_indptr` must start at zero and contain bounded, monotone rows with at
least `ceil(seq_lens_kv[b] / page_size)` entries; every physical page ID in
the live prefix ending at `paged_kv_indptr[-1]` must lie in `[0, P)`. Every BSR
row must have bounded offsets, strictly increasing unique block IDs, and at
most the planned `max_blocks_per_row` entries. Contiguous IDs must lie below
`ceil(seq_len_kv / kv_block_size)`; paged IDs must start below the owning
request's live K/V length.

Reusable wrappers validate tensor structure but read values directly without
host synchronization. Invalid values therefore have undefined behavior and
may access out of bounds. Set `CUTE_DSL_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=1` before the process
first compiles these kernels to diagnose violations encountered while preparing
selected routes; such assertions report asynchronously and leave the CUDA
context unusable. The one-shot APIs instead synchronize once to validate all
live values, including the complete physical-page-ID prefix, before creating
their temporary plans and cannot run during CUDA Graph capture.

The one-shot `block_sparse_attention_with_paged_kv_cache` API takes
`max_seq_len_kv` as the static capacity and requires `seq_lens_kv` with the
live per-request logical lengths. Paged PrimTS does not support packed or
mixed/variable Q lengths.
Eager launches retain all launch tensors on the run stream; CUDA Graph users
must keep the wrapper and Q/cache/output/runtime-metadata tensors alive and
unmodified until replay completes. Values may change between completed replays
while tensor addresses, shapes, dtypes, and strides remain stable.

Qualified Q64/coarse-KV profiles retain KV256 routes for page sizes 64 and
128. Optional `kv_valid_bits` is a `torch.uint32` per-request bitset with shape
`[B, ceil(max_seq_len_kv / 32)]` over logical KV tokens; it is shared by all KV
heads and independent of the physical page mapping.

## Validation
