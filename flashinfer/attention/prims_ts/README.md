# Experimental Task-Scheduled Attention

`flashinfer.attention.prims_ts` exposes experimental CuTe DSL attention
kernels for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. Scheduling, tile selection, and split-KV
reduction are implementation details; the public interfaces expose attention
and cache semantics without tuning knobs.

Current accuracy and performance signoff is on SM100a/B200. SM103a/B300 is
admitted by the runtime architecture guard but is not yet signoff-qualified.

The component guides define supported shapes, layouts, metadata lifetime,
output/workspace ownership, examples, limitations, and validation commands.

For `BlockSparsePagedTSWrapper`, `plan` freezes only the compact fixed-Q
geometry, dtypes, sparse-route capacity, and `max_seq_len_kv`; it retains no
request metadata. Every `run` reads live paged-KV row offsets, physical page
IDs, per-request K/V lengths, per-KV-head sparse routes, and optional token
bits from device tensors. The physical-page ID tensor is capacity: its live
prefix ends at `paged_kv_indptr[-1]`, which may be smaller than its `numel()`.
The caller owns the live length value contract: dense K/V lengths must be in
`[1, max_seq_len_kv]`, and causal lengths must be in `[Sq, max_seq_len_kv]`.
Attention reads those lengths directly; out-of-range values are unsupported
instead of guaranteed to fail closed. Given valid lengths, invalid page-table
or route metadata fails the affected request or row closed to finite zero
without a host synchronization.

The one-shot `block_sparse_attention_with_paged_kv_cache` API keeps
`seq_len_kv` as the maximum-capacity keyword. Its optional `seq_lens_kv`
argument supplies live per-request lengths; omitting it uses that maximum for
every request. Paged PrimTS does not support packed or mixed/variable Q lengths.
Eager launches retain all launch tensors on the run stream; CUDA Graph users
must keep the wrapper and Q/cache/output/runtime-metadata tensors alive and
unmodified until replay completes. Values may change between completed replays
while tensor addresses, shapes, dtypes, and strides remain stable.

Qualified Q64/coarse-KV profiles retain KV256 routes for page sizes 64 and
128. Optional `kv_valid_bits` is a `torch.uint32` per-request bitset with shape
`[B, ceil(max_seq_len_kv / 32)]` over logical KV tokens; it is shared by all KV
heads and independent of the physical page mapping.
