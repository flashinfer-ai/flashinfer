# Experimental Task-Scheduled Attention

`flashinfer.attention.prims_ts` exposes experimental CuTe DSL attention
kernels for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. Scheduling, tile selection, and split-KV
reduction are implementation details; the public interfaces expose attention
and cache semantics without tuning knobs.

Current accuracy and performance signoff is on SM100a/B200. SM103a/B300 is
admitted by the runtime architecture guard but is not yet signoff-qualified.

The component guides define supported shapes, layouts, metadata lifetime,
output/workspace ownership, examples, limitations, and validation commands.

For `BlockSparsePagedTSWrapper`, `plan` freezes the logical fixed-Q geometry
and copies the paged-KV row offsets and optional per-request K/V lengths into
plan-owned storage. When lengths are provided, the scalar K/V length is the
static maximum; each page-table row may contain spare entries beyond its live
length. `run` consumes live physical page IDs and per-KV-head sparse routes,
and every selected BSR block must start before that request's frozen live K
length. A violating sorted row fails closed. Eager
launches retain all launch tensors on the run stream; CUDA Graph users must
keep the wrapper and Q/cache/output/runtime-metadata tensors alive and
unmodified until replay completes.

Qualified Q64/coarse-KV profiles retain KV256 routes for page sizes 64 and
128. Optional `kv_valid_bits` is a `torch.uint32` per-request bitset with shape
`[B, ceil(max_seq_len_kv / 32)]` over logical KV tokens; it is shared by all KV
heads and independent of the physical page mapping.
