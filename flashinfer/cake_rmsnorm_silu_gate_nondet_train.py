Cake SiLU-gated RMSNorm training forward / backward (SM100 / SM103 / SM107)
of the non-deterministic family (``nondet``).  Every entry point runs only the
kernels of this family; the deterministic package is
:mod:`flashinfer.cake_rmsnorm_silu_gate_det_train`.

Forward, per row of 128 of ``x`` and the matching row of the separate gate
input ``z`` (``[T, H, 128]`` or ``[T * H, 128]``, BF16; ``weight`` ``[128]``
shared by every token and head)::

    rstd = 1 / sqrt(mean(x^2) + eps)                     # FP32
    y    = BF16(((x * rstd) * weight) * silu(z))         # FP32, one rounding

The backward recomputes the statistics and the gate from ``x`` and ``z`` and
returns BF16 ``dx`` and ``dz`` and the weight gradient summed over every token
and head, rounded once to FP32 (and that to BF16 for a BF16 weight gradient).
The autograd function saves only its inputs, which keeps
``torch.utils.checkpoint(..., use_reentrant=False)`` free of FP32 temporaries.
No call synchronizes the host or the device; ``T`` and ``H`` are runtime
values.

Every output repeats bit for bit: the same inputs on the same device give the
same ``y``, ``dx``, ``dz`` and weight gradient on every call, whatever the
grid, the order in which CTAs run and the work beside the call on other
streams.  The kernels are those of the standalone package
``flashinfer.experimental.cake.cake_rmsnorm_silu_gate_nondet_train``:

- The forward computes ``rstd`` with ``rsqrt.approx`` and the SiLU gate with
  ``ex2.approx`` of ``-|z| log2(e)`` and ``rcp.approx`` (no flush of a nonzero
  sigmoid of a normal ``z``); its bits are not the deterministic package's.
  Up to 12 rows per SM on SM100 and SM103 (59 on SM107) a forward with 16
  threads to a row runs, and past that forwards whose CTAs each walk several
  row blocks, in bands of rows per SM.  Each forward program's arithmetic is
  fixed, but the programs associate a row's sum of squares differently (the
  16-thread forward: 8-term FMA chains of 16 lanes folded by XOR shuffles 1,
  2, 4, 8; the others: 16-term chains of 8 lanes folded by 1, 2, 4; the row
  count and the SM count pick the program), so ``y``'s bits can differ
  between bands while each program repeats them for the same inputs on the
  same device.
- The backward is one kernel over the deterministic backward's chunks of rows
  (8-row blocks, ``max(1, ceil(blocks / 8192))`` blocks a chunk): ``dx`` and
  ``dz`` are the deterministic backward's arithmetic, each chunk's FP32
  weight-gradient partial is the deterministic backward's, and the partials
  are added exactly, as signed 64-bit integer windows of their FP32 values (an
  addition of integers does not depend on its order); the CTA that arrives
  last rounds the exact sum once into the weight gradient.  So the weight
  gradient is the deterministic package's bits except where the exact sum lies
  within the deterministic FP64 sum's error of a rounding boundary, and an
  infinite or ``NaN`` partial gives its column the class the FP64 sum gives
  it.  While every chunk has a CTA of one wave (8 CTAs per SM) CTA ``b`` runs
  chunk ``b``; past that the CTAs claim runs of chunks from the workspace's
  claim counter, so a CTA that starts late takes fewer.  A call of few rows
  (up to 1024 rows on sm_100a and sm_107a and 620 on sm_103a with a BF16
  weight gradient or with ``compute_grad_weight=False``, up to 1024, 720 and
  900 rows on sm_100a, sm_103a and sm_107a with an FP32 one) runs one
  thread-block cluster of 16 CTAs, its ``dx`` and ``dz`` the same arithmetic,
  which adds the weight-gradient partials of each column in a fixed order in
  FP64, rounds that sum to FP32 (then to BF16 for a BF16 weight gradient) and
  uses no workspace.

Mode and dispatch rules:

1. The mode is part of every name.  Every public name of the deterministic
   module :mod:`flashinfer.cake_rmsnorm_silu_gate_det_train` (backend package
   ``flashinfer.experimental.cake.cake_rmsnorm_silu_gate_det_train``) carries
   ``det``; every public name of the non-deterministic module
   :mod:`flashinfer.cake_rmsnorm_silu_gate_nondet_train` (backend package
   ``flashinfer.experimental.cake.cake_rmsnorm_silu_gate_nondet_train``)
   carries ``nondet``.  The module constants ``ARCHES`` and
   ``SUPPORTED_COMPUTE_CAPABILITIES`` are exempt: they keep their names,
   without a mode word, in both modules and both backend packages.  The
   ``flashinfer`` top level exports only names with a mode word.
   Each module imports its backend package on first use (``import
   flashinfer`` loads neither backend package); its autograd class and
   its architecture constants are the backend package's objects.
2. No entry point takes a ``deterministic`` keyword: passing one is a
   ``TypeError``.  A call of one package never runs the other package.
3. Under ``torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`` no call of this module
   alerts: every output repeats bit for bit.
4. Autograd: ``CakeRMSNormSiLUGateDetFunction`` and
   ``CakeRMSNormSiLUGateNondetFunction`` save only ``x``, ``z`` and ``weight``
   and run the backward of their own package.  A backward workspace serves
   only its own package (FP32 for the deterministic package, ``torch.uint8``
   for the non-deterministic one).  This package's backward refuses the
   deterministic package's workspace (``ValueError``) in every call, also with
   no rows; the deterministic backward refuses this package's workspace in a
   call with rows.
5. The former names are gone, with no alias or shim: the former modules fail
   at import, and the former names without a mode word are attributes of
   neither ``flashinfer`` nor either module.  The SiLU-gated RMSNorm section
   of ``docs/api/norm.rst`` maps each former name to its names in both modes.

The non-deterministic backward's workspace
(``cake_rmsnorm_silu_gate_nondet_train_backward_workspace(T * H, device)``, a
zero-filled ``torch.uint8`` tensor of 29192 bytes whatever ``T * H``) holds the
integer windows of the exact sum, 128 FP32 class words, the arrival ticket and
the claim counter; every launch of that backward uses one, also with
``compute_grad_weight=False``, but the one-cluster backward of a call of few
rows, which reads none.  The kernel leaves it zero: allocate it once, reuse it
across calls, shapes, both weight-gradient dtypes and CUDA Graph replays
without a reset, and give each stream that may run a backward at the same
time its own buffer.  A buffer that did not come from that factory, or that
anything else wrote into, must be zeroed with
``cake_rmsnorm_silu_gate_nondet_train_reset_workspace(ws)`` before its next
backward.  It is not interchangeable with the deterministic package's FP32
buffer: this package's backward refuses that buffer (``ValueError``) in every
call, and the deterministic backward refuses this one in a call with rows.
Calls without a workspace use one buffer per device, stream and backward
kernel that takes one (two per weight-gradient dtype: one for the one-wave
backward, one for the claimed backward; none for the one-cluster backward),
kept for later calls; the autograd node retains nothing else.  They also keep a reserve of 64 zero-filled buffers per device (about
1.8 MiB, filled outside any capture): a call during CUDA Graph capture takes
one per capture and capture stream from it and keeps it for the life of the
process, so a replay launches no fill kernel (with none ready, the graph
zero-fills a buffer of its own).

Beside kernels resident on other streams (FlashInfer issue #7548): an SM
serves a CTA only once it can switch to a shared-memory carveout that holds
the CTA's dynamic shared memory, so a kernel on another stream whose CTAs hold
every SM with a small carveout (for example a long-running kernel with little
or no shared memory and the default carveout) can delay the start of a kernel
of this module until it exits.  Setting
``cudaFuncAttributePreferredSharedMemoryCarveout`` to
``cudaSharedmemCarveoutMaxShared`` on such a resident kernel, or giving it a
large dynamic shared-memory allocation, lets the backward start beside it.

    eps : float
        The forward's epsilon.
    grad_x, grad_z : torch.Tensor, optional
        Preallocated BF16 outputs of ``x``'s shape.
    grad_weight : torch.Tensor, optional
        A BF16 or FP32 ``[128]`` tensor that receives the weight gradient
        (the exact sum rounded to FP32, and to BF16 from there for a BF16
        tensor).  Without it a new BF16 tensor is returned.
    accumulate_grad_weight : bool
        Add the gradient to ``grad_weight``'s current value before the
        rounding (exactly on the static and the claimed backward; in FP64
        before the rounding in the small-row bands; needs ``grad_weight``).
        A call with no rows leaves the accumulator as it is.
    compute_grad_weight : bool
        ``False`` skips the weight-gradient reduction and returns ``None`` for
        it.  A call of few rows runs the one-cluster backward, which uses
        no workspace (a ``workspace`` passed is checked and left as it is).
        With more rows the kernel touches neither ``grad_weight`` nor the
        workspace's windows, but its CTAs still take the arrival ticket (and
        past one wave claim their chunks from the claim counter), so it uses a
        workspace too (and leaves it zero).
    workspace : torch.Tensor, optional
        Caller-owned zero-filled ``torch.uint8`` buffer from
        :func:`cake_rmsnorm_silu_gate_nondet_train_backward_workspace`, which the
        kernel leaves zero (zero it with

        kernel, kept for later calls (during CUDA Graph capture, one
        zero-filled buffer per capture and capture stream, from a reserve
